# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project for production
- npm run dev: Build and launch local development environment

# Code style
- Use NEXTjs and TypeScript with Bootstrap
- always comment code
- version and date stamp each file
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when you’re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
